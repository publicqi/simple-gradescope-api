## Since

I missed my first quiz for CS64 which weighted **4.375%** in total. And quiz 1 is a freaking easy one. Now I have to get 100% in each following quiz and the final and each labs to get a A for sure. Goodbye A+ :/

## So

I decided to write a application that can send me emails about deadlines on Gradescope.

## simple?

The api will copy some code from [apozharski/gradescope-api](https://github.com/apozharski/gradescope-api). I don't need that many functions so this repo is a simplified version.
